# FairlySwap

FairlySwap is an original DApp concept that enables BTC ↔ SOL deposits and balance checks, powered by Internet Computer (ICP) mock canisters.  
This project is a starting point for experimenting with cross-chain swaps.

## Features
- Deposit BTC and SOL (mock integration with ICP canisters)
- Check balances linked to your Principal ID
- Simple UI (desktop + mobile friendly)
- Foundation for future BTC ↔ SOL swap integration

## Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run start
open http://localhost:5173
